# MultivJoint

MultivJoint.R: This R script is associated to the article entitled "Fast and flexible inference for joint models of multivariate longitudinal and survival data using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations". It includes the generation and estimation codes for scenario 10 of the simulation studies (with 3 longitudinal markers of different nature).

PBC_INLA.R: This R script includes the estimation code that replicates the model from the application section of the same article.

Priorsensitivity.R: This code replicates the prior sensitivity analysis from Appendix C of the same article.
